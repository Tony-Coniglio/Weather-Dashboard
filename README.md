# Weather-Dashboard

## Overview

In this challenge I attempted to create a weather dashboard to get a 5-day weather forcast dependent on the user input.

## Current Issues

I was successfull in getting the api set up and displaying the information that was returned. However, I am unable to figure out the card clearer to clear the previous results. Additionally I was unable to get to local storage due to time constraints but I will be adding that in the near future.

## Future Developement

In the future I will be correcting the issues listed above.

## Additional Information

This app was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
